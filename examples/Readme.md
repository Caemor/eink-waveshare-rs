# Examples:

All of these examples are projects of their own. 

A few notes:
 - If not stated otherwise the example is for a Raspberry Pi running Linux.
 - epdXinYY_full showcase most of what can be done with this crate. This means that they are using graphics feature and use the DisplayXinYY with its buffer. 

Special Examples:

### epd4in2_var_display_buffer

This examples used the graphics feature with VarDisplay and therefore a variable buffer(size).

### epd1in54_no_graphics (Fastest Example)

This example doesn't use the graphics feature and handles all the "drawing" by itself. It also has a speeddemonstration included.
